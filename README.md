# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is my attempt at the game tic tac toe.
The code is not commented but easy to understand and read throw
---------------------------------------------------------------
You can take the code and exe(exe is to directly run the game, you will not requir any complier )
The whole game has been written in a manner. That there is no use of any external assets, like images or text.
Every object you can see is Drawn using inbuilt python by game draw functions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you would like to work on the code , you can go in by adding an option,
To let the player select when he is playing against the AI, Who is going to start the match?
